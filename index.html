			<p>The kangaroo may just be the first animal that comes to mind when Americans think of “The Land Down Under” (a.k.a. Australia). Indigenous to Australia, kangaroos are a part of the marsupial sub-class of mammals. They are typically known for their stomach pouch in which they carry young offspring, their very powerful hind legs, and their long-shaped faces. There are several types of kangaroos in Australia with the most abundant being the eastern grey kangaroo. Other types include the red kangaroo as well as the antilopine kangaroo. </p>

		 <p>Kangaroos are a flourishing population in Australia, and are referred to by many names. Male kangaroos are often referred to as bucks, boomers, or jacks; female kangaroos are often referred to as does, flyers, or jills; and the young ones are often called joeys. </p>
		 <p>There are only four species of kangaroos, with the red kangaroo being considered the largest marsupial in the world. All four are listed below:</p>
